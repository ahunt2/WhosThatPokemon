# Who's That Pokemon

Viewers of the animated Pokemon TV show might remember a guessing game
played in between commercial breaks, where you would have to guess which
pokemon belonged to a silhouetted image on the screen.  This app was made
to recreate that game with a ReactJS web application with some bonus features.

A live version of the app can be found at [Who's That Pokemon] (https://whosthatpokemonguessinggame.netlify.app/)
